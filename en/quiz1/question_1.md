legend: Question 1 of 3

An NPC has a script that uses the `SimpleMove` method in its `Update` method. 

Which component needs to be added to the Player so it can use the `SimpleMove` method?

--- choices ---

- ( ) A 'Script' component

  --- feedback ---

  No, the NPC will need a Script component to control its movement, but that will not give it the `SimpleMove` method.

- ( ) A 'Box Collider' component

  --- feedback ---

  No, Box Colliders are used to control the Physics of a GameObject to prevent collision or as a trigger for a collision event.

- (x) A 'Character Controller' component

  --- feedback ---

  That's right, adding the Character Controller component would allow the Player to use the `SimpleMove` method.

- ( ) An 'Animator' component

  --- feedback ---

  An Animator component controls how the GameObject looks. It does not provide a `SimpleMove` method for moving around.
