legend: Question 1 of 3

Which component do you need to add to an NPC so it can use the `SimpleMove` method?

--- choices ---

- ( ) A Script component

  --- feedback ---

  No, the NPC will need a Script component to control its movement, but that will not give it the `SimpleMove` method.

- ( ) A Box Collider component

  --- feedback ---

  No, Box Colliders are used to control the physics of a GameObject to prevent collision or as a trigger for a collision event.  

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) A Character Controller component

  --- feedback ---

  That's right, adding the Character Controller component allows the Player to use the `SimpleMove` method.  

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) An Animator component

  --- feedback ---

  An Animator component controls how the GameObject looks. It does not provide a `SimpleMove` method for moving around.
