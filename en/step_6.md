With the Rat selected go to the Inspector window and 'Add Component'. Choose the 'Character Controller'. Position and size the controller so it covers centre of the Rat:

Go to the 'Add Component' button again and add a 'Box Collider' to the Rat. 

Check 'IsTrigger' and change the size so that it is bigger than the Character controller:
